        Pranit Chaulagain, born on November 9, 2006, is a young Nepali rapper and music artist known by his stage name, Youngster. His journey in music began at a young age, inspired by the struggles and stories around him, much like his idol Yama Buddha. Growing up, Pranit found his passion for music as a means to express himself and bring awareness to societal issues, much like how Yama Buddha used hip hop as a tool for social change.
